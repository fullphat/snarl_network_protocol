# Developer Guide

The Snarl Network Protocol (pronounced as "snap", and abbreviated to "SNP") is a platform-agnostic TCP/IP protocol used to transmit notifications between computers on the same network, or even across the Internet.  It's highly extensible and is both easy to read and easy to implement - there are libraries available for .net and Python already, and likely other languages as well.
