When launched, opens a TCP socket on the specified port (or 9887 if none provided) and listens for incoming SNP/3.0 packets.

If run on MacOS (Mavericks or later), it will generate notifications using the built-in OS X notification system; if run on Ubuntu (or any other Linux platform which includes "notify-send‚Äù), it will generate notifications using that tool.


Command-line:

	python3.4/snpd.py [port=9887]
