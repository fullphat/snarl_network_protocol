SNP defines two primary protocols which allow computers to generate notifications using [Snarl](http://snarl.fullphat.net) running on a remote (or local) computer.  One flavour of SNP is better suited to corporate networks; the other can work across the Internet.

Check out the following for more information:

- The [Wiki](https://github.com/fullphat/snarl_network_protocol/wiki) contains a lot of information about the different flavours of SNP and ready-made tools and demos you can try out
- The [Developer Guide](https://fullphat.github.io/snarl_network_protocol/) is where you can find the formal SNP documentation
- You can download various SNP clients, servers and development tools from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/snarlwin/files/SNP/)
