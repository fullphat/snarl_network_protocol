A demo chat application using Snarl...


To get up and running...
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

o Make sure have Snarl 5.0 Beta 2 or later installed on a computer

o Make sure Snarl is listening for incoming SNP 3.1 FORWARDed notifications

o Run Chat-o-licious!

o Enter the server name and port of the SNP 3.1 listener in Chat-o-licious!

o Enter some chat text

o Click "Send"


If the user on the other computer also runs Chat-o-licious! and you create a
SNP 3.1 listening port on Snarl too, they can send you chat notifications as
well. B)




Future improvements
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

While this demo is not in active development, features we might add include:

o Service discovery: use SNPD to find remote Snarl servers that accept forwards
